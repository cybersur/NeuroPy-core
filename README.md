NeuroPyâ„¢ Core Libraries: Comprehensive Documentation for GitHub

1. Introduction
NeuroPyâ„¢ is an advanced Python-based framework designed for developing Neural Cognitive Networks (NCNs) and synthetic intelligence models. It provides essential libraries to build, train, and deploy neuro-inspired AI systems, integrating spiking neural networks (SNNs), predictive coding, reinforcement learning, and deep learning architectures.

The NeuroPyâ„¢ Core Libraries are fundamental components within the framework, supporting a wide range of AI applications, including cognitive computing, autonomous systems, robotics, and advanced decision-making models.

2. Creation of NeuroPyâ„¢
  Creator: Dr. Rigoberto Garcia
  Project: Positronic Brain Research (Cognetive Analysis) ML Models

  Development Start Date: Originally conceptualized in the early 2015s
  
  Project Name: PAID - Model - SYN-00 â†’ SYN-01 (Positronic Synthetic Intelligence Neural Network)
  
  Objective: NeuroPyâ„¢ was initially developed as part of the SYN-00 project to facilitate the evolution of synthetic cognition by simulating human-like learning, perception, and decision-making in artificial systems.
